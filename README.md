## General Information
This repository holds projects that I completed as a student of Yandex Practicum's Data Science Specialist program.

The Yandex program focuses on training students in skills needed to begin a career in Data Science. This most significantly focuses on the use of Python and a number of different libraries and approaches, as well as on the development of statistical analysis and critical thinking skills. For more detailed information, please see the project descriptions below.

## Projects:
1. Comparison of Listening Habits of Music Service Users in Two Different Cities
2. Analysis of Factors Influencing Lendees' Ability to Pay Back Debt
3. Real Estate Market Analysis – Establishing Pricing Norms for Fraud Detection and Recommendation System
4. Analysis of Telecom Service Usage
5. Image Analysis to Estimate Age of Supermarket Clients
6. Telecom Analysis to Recommend New Plans for Users
7. Bank Client Churn Analysis
8. Analysis of Borehole Information to Establish Most Profitable Location for Oil Well
9. Optimization of Industrial Gold Refinement Process
10. Anonymization of Personal Details
11. Sale Price Recommendation System for Autosales Platform
12. Prediction of Number of Taxi Rides Ordered in Following Hour
13. Classification of Comments as Toxic or Non-Toxic


## 1. Comparison of Listening Habits of Music Service Users in Two Different Cities
Tools: Python, Pandas
Goal: Verify three hypotheses about the music listening habits of users in Moscow and Saint Petersburg.
Data from music service was analyzed to establish how habits differ within one city (i.e. from day to day or at different times) and between the two cities.
Topics/Techniques:

## 2. Analysis of Factors Influencing Lendees Ability to Pay Back Debt
Tools: Python, Pandas
Goal: Analyze the connection between social factors (marital status, children, etc.) and loan repayment
Data from the lending division of a bank was analyzed to establish how social factors influence an individual's ability to repay loans. Factors were studied individually, not in conjunction with one another.
Topics/Techniques:

## 3. Real Estate Market Analysis – Establishing Pricing Norms for Fraud Detection and Recommendation System
Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib
Goal: Predict price of real estate objects to recommend sale price to new sellers and to find suspicious postings
Data from real estate platform was analyzed to establish norms for real estate pricing in Saint Petersburg based on features of each given object (e.g. rooms, floor, ...) as well as distance from center.
Topics/Techniques:

## 4. Analysis of Telecom Service Usage
Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, SciPy
Goal: Establish most profitable service plan based on usage
Data from telecom company was analyzed to find which plans bring the most profit. Data was also analyzed to compare how plans affect profit in Moscow and in other cities.
Topics/Techniques:

## 5. Image Analysis to Estimate Age of Supermarket Clients
Tools: Python, Matplotlib, NumPy, Keras
Goal: Train model to predict age of client based on image of face
Data from APPA-REAL was used in conjunction with ResNet50 to predict age based on images of face.
Topics/Techniques:

## 6. Telecom Analysis to Recommend New Plans for Users
Tools: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn
Goal: Recommend new plans for users based on their current usage of telecom services
Data from telecom company was used to analyze service usage of users to suggest most appropriate plan.
Topics/Techniques:

## 7. Bank Client Churn Analysis
Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn
Goal: Predict if client will leave bank in the near future
Data from bank was analyzed to train model that predicts if a client will close their accounts in the near future.
Topics/Techniques:

## 8. Analysis of Borehole Information to Establish Most Profitable Location for Oil Well
Tools:
