# student_projects

### The projects themselves will be added this week, once I have removed all of the identifying information and data, which does not belong to me.

## General Information
This repository holds projects that I completed as a student of Yandex Practicum's Data Science Specialist program.

The Yandex program focuses on training students in skills needed to begin a career in Data Science. This most significantly focuses on the use of Python and a number of different libraries and approaches, as well as on the development of statistical analysis and critical thinking skills. For more detailed information, please see the project descriptions below.

## 1. Comparison of Listening Habits of Music Service Users in Two Different Cities
Tools: Python, Pandas

Goal: Verify three hypotheses about the music listening habits of users in Moscow and Saint Petersburg.

Data from music service was analyzed to establish how habits differ within one city (i.e. from day to day or at different times) and between the two cities.

Topics/Techniques: Data cleaning, missing values, grouping, sorting

## 2. Analysis of Factors Influencing Lendees Ability to Pay Back Debt
Tools: Python, Pandas

Goal: Analyze the connection between social factors (marital status, children, etc.) and loan repayment

Data from the lending division of a bank was analyzed to establish how social factors influence an individual's ability to repay loans. Factors were studied individually, not in conjunction with one another.

Topics/Techniques: Data cleaning, duplicates, missing values

## 3. Real Estate Market Analysis – Establishing Pricing Norms for Fraud Detection and Recommendation System
Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib

Goal: Predict price of real estate objects to recommend sale price to new sellers and to find suspicious postings

Data from real estate platform was analyzed to establish norms for real estate pricing in Saint Petersburg based on features of each given object (e.g. rooms, floor, ...) as well as distance from center.

Topics/Techniques: Data cleaning, categorization, visualization, fraud monitoring

## 4. Analysis of Telecom Service Usage
Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, SciPy

Goal: Establish most profitable service plan based on usage

Data from telecom company was analyzed to find which plans bring the most profit. Data was also analyzed to compare how plans affect profit in Moscow and in other cities.

Topics/Techniques: Data cleaning, visualization, statistic analysis, t-test

## 5. Image Analysis to Estimate Age of Supermarket Clients
Tools: Python, Matplotlib, NumPy, Keras

Goal: Train model to predict age of client based on image of face

Data from APPA-REAL was used in conjunction with ResNet50 to predict age based on images of face.

Topics/Techniques: Computer vision, neural networks

## 6. Telecom Analysis to Recommend New Plans for Users
Tools: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn

Goal: Recommend new plans for users based on their current usage of telecom services

Data from telecom company was used to analyze service usage of users to suggest most appropriate plan.

Topics/Techniques: Classification, hyperparameter tuning, ML model selection

## 7. Bank Client Churn Analysis
Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn

Goal: Predict if client will leave bank in the near future

Data from bank was analyzed to train model that predicts if a client will close their accounts in the near future.

Topics/Techniques: Classification, hyperparameter tuning, ML model selection

## 8. Analysis of Borehole Information to Establish Most Profitable Location for Oil Well
Tools: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn

Goal: Determine most profitable region for oil drilling

Borehole testing data from oil company was used to establish a. the most profitable and b. the most sure choice of region for drilling a new oil well.

Topics/Techniques: Regression, bootstrap, business model analysis

## 9. Optimization of Industrial Gold Refinement Process
Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, scikit-learn

Goal: Use ML to optimize the gold refinement process

Data gathered from each stage of an industrial gold refinement process was used to create a model that would predict the purity of the final product, which would then be used to optimize the refinement process to produce the purest final result.

Topics/Techniques: Data analysis, regression, custom metrics

## 10. Anonymization of Personal Details
Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn

Goal: Use principles of linear algebra and matrices to transform and anonymize client data without affecting model prediction accuracy.

This project consisted of two parts. The theoretical part required proving that data transformation through matrix multiplication would not affect model prediction and accuracy. The second part was the implementation of such an approach on personal data from an insurance company.

Topics/Techniques: linear algebra, matrices, regression

## 11. Sale Price Recommendation System for Autosales Platform
Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, Optuna

Goal: Use description of cars to create list price recommendation system for used car site

Data from automobile sales site was used to train a model to predict listing price of vehicles to be implemented as suggestion system. Different models were compared using the following three criteria: quality of prediction (metric: RMSE), speed of prediction, training time.

Topics/Techniques: gradient boosting, regression

## 12. Prediction of Number of Taxi Rides Ordered in Following Hour
Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, statsmodels, scikit-learn, LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, Optuna

Goal: Use previous data about number of taxis ordered to predict the number of taxis to be ordered in the following hour

Data from taxi service was used to train model that would predict the number of taxis needed in the hour following the end of the data given to the model. Several approaches were used to achieve the given goal, including exponential smoothing, SARIMA, and regression models trained using time lag information.

Topics/Techniques: time series analysis, exponential smoothing, SARIMA, gradient boosting, regression

## 13. Classification of Comments as Toxic or Non-Toxic
Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, Optuna, PyTorch, BERT

Goal: Use an NLP approach to determine the toxicity of a given comment

Labeled data from a wikisite was used to train a neural network that predicts if a comment is toxic or not.

Topics/Techniques: NLP, neural networks
