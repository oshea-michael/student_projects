# Bank Churn Analysis

## Overview:

Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn

Goal: Predict if client will leave bank in the near future

Data from bank was analyzed to train model that predicts if a client will close their accounts in the near future.

Topics/Techniques: Classification, hyperparameter tuning, ML model selection

## Description:

The goal of this project is to train and test a model that will predict if a bank client is likely to leave. The bank's marketing department requires such a model so that they will be able to actively work on keeping clients who are considering leaving, rather than working on attracting new clients.

The data used for this project includes banking and financial information (bank services used, credit score, estimated salary, etc.) as well as basic personal information (age, gender, country of residence).

The metric used to draw conclusions about model performance was F1-score, although AUC-ROC was also looked at for comparative purposes.
