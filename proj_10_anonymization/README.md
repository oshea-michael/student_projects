# Anonymization of Personal Details

## Overview:

Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn

Goal: Use principles of linear algebra and matrices to transform and anonymize client data without affecting model prediction accuracy.

This project consisted of two parts. The theoretical part required proving that data transformation through matrix multiplication would not affect model prediction and accuracy. The second part was the implementation of such an approach on personal data from an insurance company.

Topics/Techniques: linear algebra, matrices, regression

## Description:

The goal of this project was to use matrices and the principles of linear algebra to anonymize personal details. This project is largely theoretical and consisted of two parts. The first part is a proof of the principle that matrix multiplication can be used to anonymize details without affecting the quality of a machine learning model. The second part is a brief implementation of this principle on a dataset to compare model accuracy results using the transformed and original data.
