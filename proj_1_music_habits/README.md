# Comparison of Listening Habits of Music Service Users in Two Different Cities

## Overview:

Tools: Python, Pandas

Goal: Verify three hypotheses about the music listening habits of users in Moscow and Saint Petersburg.

Data from music service was analyzed to establish how habits differ within one city (i.e. from day to day or at different times) and between the two cities.

Topics/Techniques: Data cleaning, missing values, grouping, sorting

## Description:

The goal of this project was to check the validity of three hypotheses about the music listening habits of users in Moscow and Saint Petersburg.

1. Listener activity depends on the day of the week, and this purported relationship expresses itself differently in Moscow and Saint Petersburg.

2. On Monday morning and on Friday evening there are specific genres that tend to be chosen, and furthermore these genres differ between Moscow and Saint Petersburg.

3. Moscow and Saint Petersburg prefer different genres more generally; listeners in Moscow more often choose pop music, and Saint Petersburg more often choose Russian rap.

The dataset was received with a variety of problems and imperfections. As such, the project was completed in three steps:
- Evaluation of quality of dataset
- Datacleaning
- Hypothesis verification
