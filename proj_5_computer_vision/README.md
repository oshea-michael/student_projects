# Image Analysis to Estimate Age of Supermarket Clients

## Overview:

Tools: Python, Matplotlib, NumPy, Keras

Goal: Train model to predict age of client based on image of face

Data from APPA-REAL was used in conjunction with ResNet50 to predict age based on images of face.

Topics/Techniques: Computer vision, neural networks

## Description:

The goal of this project is to determine the age of clients based on images of their face. Unlike some other projects in this collection of student work, the purpose of this project was very much to understand the mechanics of CV and of working with neural networks. As such, conclusions are limited and the chosen approach is more strictly defined by the requirements of the project.

This project was done with remote access to a dataset that I do not have access to locally. The images themselves are available online from ChaLearn, but because the data was organized/stored in a significantly different manner, I needed to approach certain parts of the project differently.
