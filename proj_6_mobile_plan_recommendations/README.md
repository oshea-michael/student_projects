# Telecom Analysis to Recommend New Plans for Users

## Overview:

Tools: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn

Goal: Recommend new plans for users based on their current usage of telecom services

Data from telecom company was used to analyze service usage of users to suggest most appropriate plan.

Topics/Techniques: Classification, hyperparameter tuning, ML model selection

## Description:

The goal of this project was to provide recommendations to clients of a telecom company, who have yet to switch to one of the two new mobile plans introduced by the company.

The data used in this project is the same data that was used for comparing the profitability of the two plans in the project Analysis of Telecom Service Usage (project 4). As such, the data is already cleaned/prepared. The end goal was different: train and test a ML classification model that can later be used for recommending plans to other clients based on their usage of the company's older plans.
