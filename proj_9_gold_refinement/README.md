# Optimization of Industrial Gold Refinement Process

## Overview:

Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, scikit-learn

Goal: Use ML to optimize the gold refinement process

Data gathered from each stage of an industrial gold refinement process was used to create a model that would predict the purity of the final product, which would then be used to optimize the refinement process to produce the purest final result.

Topics/Techniques: Data analysis, regression, custom metrics

## Description:

The goal of this project is to help a mineral extraction company optimize their gold refinement process using machine learning.

The dataset includes information about different stages of the gold refinement process. Different ML models will be compared to choose the one that is most effective in predicting gold content in the final product, and the most successful model will then be used to aid in the company in the optimization process. The primary metric used for assessing model performance was SMAPE. The data was received with missing values and other such imperfections; because of this, the data will be cleaned and an exploratory analysis will be performed before training and choosing ML models.
